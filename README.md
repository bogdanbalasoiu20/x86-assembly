This repository contains my final project for the Architecture of Computer Systems course from the first semester of my first year in college. The project is based on Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, with the game implemented in the first file (keyboard input) and the third file (reading input from a file). Additionally, the second file includes encryption and decryption derived from the game.
